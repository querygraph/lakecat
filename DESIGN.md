# LakeCat Design

Updated: 2026-06-19

Status: living design. This document supersedes the OPUS review/design notes
that are now archived under `docs/completed/`.

## Purpose

LakeCat is the Rust-native Iceberg-compatible catalog foundation for
QueryGraph. It should preserve the standard Iceberg table boundary while
bringing planning, governance, graph projection, lineage, and agent-facing
evidence as close to the data as possible.

The catalog boundary stays intentionally thin:

- Iceberg REST compatibility, identity, tenancy, namespace/table/view state,
  metadata-pointer compare-and-swap, idempotency, audit, and outbox events live
  in LakeCat.
- Iceberg format behavior, manifest handling, pruning, metadata-as-data, and
  reusable scan-planning helpers belong in Sail.
- Graph schema, taxonomy, projection mechanics, traversal, graph stores, and
  Cypher behavior belong in Grust.
- Governance semantics, policy composition, TypeDID envelopes, capabilities,
  secure agents, and proofs belong in TypeSec.
- QueryGraph is the end-to-end integration target for Croissant, CDIF, OSI,
  ODRL, OpenLineage, agent workflows, and QGLake acceptance.

## Consolidation Note

The historical OPUS files remain available for audit:

- `docs/completed/OPUS1.md`
- `docs/completed/OPUS1-DESIGN.md`
- `docs/completed/OPUS2.md`
- `docs/completed/OPUS2-DESIGN.md`

They should not be treated as active instructions. Current work should read
this file, `AGENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `GOAL.md`, `STATUS.md`, and the live
code. If those disagree, prefer the live code and newest status/design entry,
then reconcile the docs in the same logical unit.

## Thesis

Iceberg constrains one layer: how table state is stored and how standard
engines talk to the catalog. Everything QueryGraph needs beyond that layer,
including graph, lineage, governance, semantic projections, and agent receipts,
belongs in the control plane or derived projections.

Keep Iceberg pristine at the boundary. Innovate around it.

```text
Derived / semantic layer
  Grust catalog graph, Croissant, CDIF, OSI, ODRL, OpenLineage
    ^
    | derived from committed state and durable events
Control plane
  identity, tenancy, Capability<A,R>, restriction, CAS, audit, outbox
    ^
    | standard catalog operations and governed privileged paths
Engine layer
  Sail catalog bridge, scan planning, manifest pruning, metadata-as-data
    ^
    | table metadata, manifests, object storage
Iceberg floor
  pristine metadata files, manifests, REST compatibility
```

## Ownership

| Concern | Owner | LakeCat role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Iceberg REST compatibility | LakeCat + Sail | Serve standard clients and prefer generated Sail models/helpers. |
| Format semantics, manifests, pruning, deletes, metadata-as-data | Sail | Call or upstream reusable APIs; do not fork them locally. |
| Identity, tenancy, pointer CAS, idempotency, audit, outbox | LakeCat | Own durable catalog state and receipts. |
| Policy, TypeDID, capability semantics, secure agents | TypeSec | Ask for decisions/proofs and persist receipts. |
| Catalog graph taxonomy, projection mechanics, stores, Cypher | Grust | Keep only catalog-facing sink boundaries in LakeCat. |
| Croissant, CDIF, OSI, ODRL, OpenLineage composition | LakeCat + QueryGraph | LakeCat emits verifiable contracts; QueryGraph composes higher-level workflows. |
| End-to-end agentic acceptance | QueryGraph | LakeCat supplies bootstrap bundles, handoff evidence, and replayable receipts. |

Dependency direction should remain:

```text
QueryGraph -> LakeCat -> Sail / Grust / TypeSec
```

LakeCat must not import QueryGraph. QueryGraph may consume LakeCat's standard
REST surface, management/bootstrap exports, outbox replay, and QGLake handoff
evidence.

## Compatibility Rules

- Do not fork Iceberg semantics or make normal table access depend on
  non-standard endpoints.
- Keep Iceberg metadata pristine. Business semantics, policies, graph facts,
  lineage, and agent state are derived control-plane or graph data.
- Prefer typed Sail support for v4 work when available. JSON passthrough is a
  compatibility bridge, not the long-term design.
- Raw credential vending is a deliberate audited exception. Governed
  Sail-planned reads are the default for agents and untrusted principals.
- Client-supplied governance filters are hints at most. The server derives the
  effective restriction.

## Critical Path: The Restriction

The central design object is the restriction:

> The server-derived, principal-specific set of allowed columns, row predicate,
> purpose, and credential TTL that a read is narrowed to.

The restriction is derived from policy, never trusted from client input, carried
by the capability, applied by Sail planning/fetch paths, and recorded in the
receipt. It is the bridge between TypeSec authorization and actual Iceberg
scan behavior.

The governed read path must keep this invariant:

```text
policy + principal + purpose
  -> TypeSec decision/proof
  -> LakeCat effective restriction
  -> Capability<principal, action, resource>
  -> Sail-planned scan / fetch-scan-tasks revalidation
  -> audit receipt and QueryGraph evidence
```

When the restriction is complete end to end, QGLake's
metadata-visible/data-denied broker is just one policy shape: metadata remains
visible, data columns are narrowed to none, and the receipt proves the decision.

## Current State

- The durable local spine uses Turso-backed catalog state behind the
  `CatalogStore` contract.
- The commit path has pointer CAS, idempotency, metadata object writes, audit,
  and outbox events.
- The Sail bridge exists as an in-process `CatalogProvider` path for governed
  catalog access; more read execution and v4 typing should still move upstream
  into Sail.
- TypeSec-backed governance is wired through the service layer, with receipts
  and fail-closed credential behavior. Policy-derived credential TTL caps are
  carried into issuance requests, returned credential config, and QGLake
  credential replay/handoff evidence.
- ODRL restrictions are no longer only transported as opaque context; the
  enforceable subset is moving through restrictions and receipts, and
  constraint-form operators now fail closed when they are missing or do not
  mean "use this value as the allowed/narrowing restriction."
- Graph and lineage side effects are moving through bounded catalog events and
  replayable outbox evidence. Grust owns reusable graph behavior.
- QueryGraph bootstrap and QGLake handoff flows now carry table and view
  evidence, view receipt chains, accepted-view chain hashes, graph/import
  proofs, and local verifier coverage.
- Local dependency-contract checks guard published Grust/TypeSec resolution,
  the remaining Sail local path/patch bridge, concrete Sail helper APIs, the
  manual-only CI trigger, and the sibling QueryGraph Rust importer's
  `receipt-chain-hash` handling.
- Automatic cloud CI remains deliberately disabled/manual until local gates are
  known to pass.

## Finding Status

| Finding | Status | Current meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F1 governed reads gate but must narrow | Started | Restrictions now flow through governed planning/fetch proof, but Sail should own more read execution. |
| F2 ODRL transported but not fully interpreted | Started | Enforceable ODRL subset is becoming restriction input; unsupported constraint operators now fail closed; broader composition stays in TypeSec/QueryGraph. |
| F3 REST commit idempotency | Started | Store support exists; REST-visible behavior needs continued hardening. |
| F4 metadata write before CAS orphan handling | Started | Commit hardening exists; cleanup and proof paths still matter. |
| F5 scans bypass in-process provider | Started | Plan/fetch paths are guarded; reusable Sail planner integration remains the target. |
| F6 graph projection still shallow | Started | Catalog graph events are bounded and expanding; reusable taxonomy/query behavior belongs in Grust. |
| F7 tenancy hierarchy not fully routed | Started | Server/project/warehouse/namespace anchors are projected and used in bootstrap. |
| F8 production secret refs | Started | Explicit provider dispatch seams fail closed and receive policy TTL caps; QGLake credential replay now proves the same TTL cap; SDK-backed resolvers beyond configured backends remain pending. |
| F9 v4 JSON passthrough | Open by design | Keep compatibility bridge until typed Sail v4 support is available. |
| F10 sibling dependency drift | Open but guarded | Local dependency-contract audits check Grust/TypeSec, Sail, QueryGraph, and manual CI state. |

## Priority Plan

### P1 Restriction End To End

Keep tightening the read path so the effective restriction is derived by the
server, carried by capability, applied by Sail plan/fetch paths, and captured in
receipts. Prefer upstream Sail APIs for any reusable planner or manifest work.

### P2 QGLake Acceptance

Keep the live QGLake handoff harness in the verification loop. QueryGraph must
continue importing LakeCat evidence without losing view receipt-chain hashes,
accepted view versions, graph proof, import proof, or OpenLineage replay
anchors. Credential replay must preserve the policy-derived TTL cap in both the
captured LakeCat replay evidence and compact handoff summary.

### P3 Commit Hardening

Continue hardening REST-visible idempotency, metadata object orphan cleanup, CAS
conflict receipts, and recovery behavior. Catalog state changes should not lose
outbox side effects.

### P4 Semantic Catalog Graph

Move graph mechanics to Grust and keep LakeCat's role to typed catalog-domain
events and sinks. Do not add traversal, schema reasoning, or graph query
behavior to LakeCat.

### P5 Tenancy And Credentials

Keep management hierarchy and credential roots durable and replayable. Raw
credential vending remains an audited exception behind TypeSec authorization;
restricted Sail-planned reads are the safer default.

### P6 Reproducibility And V4

Keep local verification ahead of cloud CI. Land reusable Sail helpers upstream
or pin published versions before removing local path/patch bridges. Replace v4
JSON passthrough with typed Sail support when Sail exposes stable APIs.

## Review Gate

Before implementing a slice:

- Read `AGENTS.md`, `STATUS.md`, this `DESIGN.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `GOAL.md`, and the relevant live code.
- Decide whether the work belongs in LakeCat or should be pushed to Sail,
  Grust, TypeSec, or QueryGraph.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` before committing.
- Update the book when behavior, public workflow, architecture, or acceptance
  evidence changes.
- Run the focused local gates first. Include
  `scripts/check-local-dependency-contract.sh` when dependency boundaries,
  sibling APIs, CI policy, or QueryGraph handoff/import evidence changes.
- Commit each logical unit only after the corresponding docs/status are
  reconciled.
